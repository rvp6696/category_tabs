# Category Tabs

This a polished and user-centric interface for selecting and viewing products from distinct categories. The dynamic data retrieval ensures an interactive and seamless user experience, with comprehensive details presented for each product, including images, pricing, and optional badge information.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

    ```bash
    $ open index.html
    ```

    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

2. The page features a header with the title "SELECT YOUR CHOICE" and a section enabling users to choose between product categories such as "Men," "Women," and "Kids."

3. Upon selecting a category, the function is invoked to retrieve product data from an API hosted on Shopify's CDN. The data is subsequently filtered based on the selected category, and the relevant product information is dynamically rendered on screen for users.
